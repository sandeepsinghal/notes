git reset <file>
which will remove it from the current index (the "about to be committed" area) without changing anything else. Note that git reset <file> is short for git reset HEAD <file>.

You can use git reset without any file name to undo all due changes. This can come handy when there are too many files to be listed one by one.


git rm --cached <file>     : remove from version control without removing the files
